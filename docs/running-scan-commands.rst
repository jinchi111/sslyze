Step 2: Running Scan Commands Against a Server
**********************************************

Every type of scan that SSLyze can run against a server (supported cipher suites, session renegotiation, etc.) is
represented by a `ScanCommand`.

Once a `ScanCommand` is run against a server, it returns a `ScanResult` which is an object with attributes containing
the results of the scan. The list of attributes and what they mean depends on what kind of scan was run (ie. which
`ScanCommand`).

All the available `ScanCommands` and corresponding `ScanResults` are described in :doc:`available-scan-commands`.

As explained in :doc:`testing-connectivity`, a properly initialized `ServerConnectivityInfo` is needed before the
corresponding server can be scanned. Then, SSLyze can run `ScanCommands` against this server either:

* Sequentially using the `SynchronousScanner` class.
* Concurrently using the `ConcurrentScanner` class; this class is slightly more complex to use, but is also a lot faster when running a several `ScanCommand` and/or scanning multiple servers.


Running Commands Sequentially
=============================

Basic example
-------------

The SynchronousScanner class can be used to run `ScanCommands` against a server:

.. literalinclude:: ../api_sample.py
   :pyobject: demo_synchronous_scanner



The SynchronousScanner class
----------------------------

.. automodule:: sslyze.synchronous_scanner
.. autoclass:: SynchronousScanner()
   :members: __init__, run_scan_command


Running Commands Concurrently
=============================

Basic example
-------------

The `ConcurrentScanner` uses a pool of processes to run `ScanCommands` concurrently. It is very fast when scanning a
large number of servers, and it has a dispatching mechanism to avoid DOS-ing a single server against which multiple
`ScanCommand` are run at the same time.

The commands can be queued using the `queue_scan_command()` method, and the results can later be retrieved using the
`get_results()` method:


.. literalinclude:: ../api_sample.py
   :pyobject: demo_concurrent_scanner


The ConcurrentScanner class
---------------------------

.. automodule:: sslyze.concurrent_scanner
.. autoclass:: ConcurrentScanner()
   :members: __init__, queue_scan_command, get_results
.. autoclass:: PluginRaisedExceptionScanResult()
