SSLyze Python API
=================

Release |version|

This is the documentation for using SSLyze as a Python module.

Overview
--------

The Python API gives full access to SSLyze's SSL/TLS scanning engine, which can analyze the SSL configuration of a
server by connecting to it, and detect various issues (bad certificates, dangerous cipher suites, lack of session
resumption, etc.).

A simple example on how to run a scan follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../api_sample.py
   :pyobject: demo_synchronous_scanner

Using SSLyze as a Python module makes it easy to implement SSL/TLS scanning as part of continuous security
testing platform, and detect any misconfiguration across a range of public and/or internal endpoints.
